* Passwords Recovery : Modded Library Based on : https://github.com/0xfd3/Chrome-Password-Recovery
* Wifi Passwords Recovery : Modded Library Based on : https://github.com/r3nhat/SharpWifiGrabber
* Loading Unmanaged DLLs in Managed EXE : Class comes from : https://github.com/schellingb/DLLFromMemory-net with manual mapping for those dlls.
* Code I used to test the loading of dll in memory (in C++ but also worked in D Lang) : 

```
BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     )
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        MessageBoxA(NULL, "Hello World!", "Dll says:", MB_OK);
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```
Note for injection:
* 32 bit dlls (in c++ or whatever you want) is for 32 bit stub
* 64 bit dlls (in c++ or whatever you want) is for 64 bit stub
* Don't inject a 32 bit dll in 64 bit stub and vice-versa (you can try if you want but the server will give you an error :))
* To use File Manager, make Refresh => All
